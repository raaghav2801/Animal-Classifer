# Dog-And-Cat-Classifier-using-CNN
This a an Image Classifier Project using Deep Learning and Convolutional Neural Networks.
It classifies images of dogs and cats using 3 Neural layers and 1 Output layer.
Tensorflow, Keras and OpenCV were used.
 We used the Dogs Vs Cats Dataset provided by Kaggle from Microsoft Download Center.
